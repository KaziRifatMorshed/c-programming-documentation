## 1. Basic C

### 1.1 What is C and why C?

- C is a general-purpose mid-level programming language, a widely-used and influential programming language that was developed in the early 1970s at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie. 

Here are some key aspects of C programming and reasons why C has been important:

- Efficiency: C is known for its efficiency and low-level control over hardware, making it an ideal choice for system programming, embedded systems, and developing software that requires high performance.

- Standard Library: C provides a rich standard library that includes functions for tasks like file I/O, memory management, string manipulation, and more. This standard library simplifies common programming tasks and allows developers to create efficient programs without reinventing the wheel.

- Learning and Teaching: Mother of Programming language. C is often recommended as a first programming language for beginners because it teaches fundamental programming concepts, such as variables, loops, and functions, in a clear and concise manner. Learning C provides a solid foundation for understanding other programming languages.

- C has been used to write everything from operating systems (including Windows and many others) to complex programs like the Python interpreter, Git, Oracle database, and more.

- C is case sensitive programming language.


### 1.2 Translator Program

A translator program is a software tool that translates code or instructions from one programming language into another. It plays a crucial role in the software development process, enabling developers to write code in high-level languages that are easier to understand and maintain, while the translator converts it into machine code that a computer can execute. There are several types of translator programs, each serving a specific purpose in this process:

1. **Compiler:**
   - **Purpose:** A compiler translates the entire source code of a program written in a high-level language into machine code or another lower-level language in one go. It generates an executable file that can run independently.
   - **Examples:** GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for C/C++, javac for Java.

2. **Interpreter:**
   - **Purpose:** An interpreter executes code line by line, translating and executing each line on the fly. It doesn't produce an independent executable; instead, it directly interprets and executes the source code.
   - **Examples:** Python interpreter, JavaScript interpreter in web browsers.

3. **Assembler:**
   - **Purpose:** An assembler translates assembly language code into machine code. Assembly language is a low-level human-readable language that corresponds closely to the architecture of a specific computer's CPU.
   - **Examples:** NASM (Netwide Assembler) for x86 assembly.

4. **Linker:**
   - **Purpose:** A linker is responsible for combining multiple object files or libraries generated by a compiler into a single executable file. It resolves references between different parts of a program.
   - **Examples:** ld (GNU Linker), Microsoft Linker (link.exe).

5. **Loader:**
   - **Purpose:** A loader loads an executable program into memory so that it can be executed by the CPU. It also performs necessary memory allocation and relocation.
   - **Examples:** The operating system's loader component.

6. **Preprocessor:**
   - **Purpose:** A preprocessor is a tool that processes the source code before compilation. It handles directives and macros, performs text substitution, and prepares the code for the compiler.
   - **Examples:** The C/C++ preprocessor, which handles `#include` and `#define` directives.

7. **Transpiler (Source-to-Source Compiler):**
   - **Purpose:** A transpiler translates code from one high-level programming language into another high-level programming language. It is often used for migrating codebases or converting code to be compatible with different platforms or frameworks.
   - **Examples:** Babel (JavaScript transpiler), TypeScript compiler (TypeScript to JavaScript).

8. **Cross-Compiler:**
   - **Purpose:** A cross-compiler is designed to generate code for a different target platform or architecture than the one it runs on. This is often used in embedded systems development.
   - **Examples:** ARM cross-compiler, used for developing software for ARM-based microcontrollers on x86-based computers.

9. **Decompiler:**
   - **Purpose:** A decompiler attempts to reverse the process of compilation by translating machine code or executable files back into a higher-level programming language or assembly language. This is often used for reverse engineering and analysis of binaries.
   - **Examples:** IDA Pro, Hex-Rays (for reverse engineering).

Each type of translator program serves a specific role in the software development process, from converting human-readable code into machine code to managing dependencies and loading the program into memory for execution. The choice of which type of translator to use depends on the programming language, target platform, and development requirements.
### 1.3 First C program

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  printf("hello world");
  return 0;
}

```

- Let's break down the code to understand each line:

  - #include <stdio.h> The function used for generating output is defined in stdio.h. In order to use the printf function, we need to first include the required file, also called a header file.

  - int main() The main() function is the entry point to a program. Curly brackets { } indicate the beginning and end of a function (also called a code block). The statements inside the brackets determine what the function does when executed.

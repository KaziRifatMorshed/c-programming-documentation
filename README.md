### What is C and why C?

- C is a general-purpose programming, a widely-used and influential programming language that was developed in the early 1970s at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie. Here are some key aspects of C programming and reasons why C has been important:

- Efficiency: C is known for its efficiency and low-level control over hardware, making it an ideal choice for system programming, embedded systems, and developing software that requires high performance.

- Standard Library: C provides a rich standard library that includes functions for tasks like file I/O, memory management, string manipulation, and more. This standard library simplifies common programming tasks and allows developers to create efficient programs without reinventing the wheel.

- C has been used to write everything from operating systems (including Windows and many others) to complex programs like the Python interpreter, Git, Oracle database, and more.

### First C program

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
  printf("hello world");
  return 0;
}

```
